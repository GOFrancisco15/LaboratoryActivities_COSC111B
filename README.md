# Laboratory Activities

This repository contains laboratory activities for **COSC 111B - CS ELECTIVE 3** (Internet of Things).  
It includes exercises from midterm and final assessments, covering Arduino programming, sensors, LEDs, and basic embedded system concepts.

Each folder contains the files needed to run the lab, including code, headers, and diagrams.

---

## Common Files in Each Lab

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main.ino` | Main Arduino sketch file (entry point) |
| `main.py` | Main Python script (if applicable) |
| `main_functions.h` | Header file with reusable functions (Arduino) |
| `breadboard_diagram.png` | Diagram showing wiring setup for the activity |

> ⚠ Note: Not all files are present in every lab. Only the files relevant to that activity are included.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino IDE  
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Basic electronic components (LEDs, sensors, breadboards)  

---

## Notes
- Each lab is **self-contained**, so files are only relevant within their folder.  
- Folders are grouped by **Midterm** and **Finals** for easier navigation.  
- This repository is intended for **learning, academic practice, and project portfolio purposes**.

## How to Use
1. Open the lab folder you want to run.  
2. For Arduino labs, open `main.ino` in Arduino IDE and upload to your board.  
3. For Python labs, ensure required libraries are installed and run `main.py`.  
4. Refer to `breadboard_diagram.png` for wiring setup when applicable.
